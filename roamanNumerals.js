 * The rules of roman numerals:
 * ==============================
 * There are six basic rules when it comes to roman numerals.
 * 
 * Rule 1: The numerals:
 * **************************
 * All roman numerals are written using a combination of base numerals and subtractive numerals.
 * There are only seven base numerals which can be used to create any numeral sequence or number representation:
 * Utilizing the base numerals, there are also six subtractive numerals which act as shortcuts to represent numerals which would otherwise require four or five individual numerals:
 *  I, V, X, L, C, D, M
 * 
 * Rule 2: The calculation:
 * **************************
 * The value of a roman numeral sequence is calculated by simply adding together the numerals, from left to right.
 * For example, the number 1988 converted to roman numerals is MCMLXXXVIII which is calculated from left-to-right as:
 *                  M+CM+L+X+X+X+V+I+I+I
 * 
 * Rule 3: Number limits:
 * **************************
 * Any sequence of standard roman numerals can only represent numbers from 1 to 3999.
 * There is no zero in roman numerals.
 * Using bracket notation or vinculum notation we can write roman numerals from 4000 to 3999999.
 * 
 * Rule 4: Sequencing:
 * **************************
 * Roman numerals are written from left to right, and from highest to lowest (in terms of individual numeral value).
 * A higher value numeral cannot appear after a lower value numeral (unless in the context of an individual subtractive numeral).
 * 
 * Rule 5: Repetition:
 * **************************
 * An individual numeral cannot appear more than three times consecutively in any sequence.
 * If you find yourself with four same-value numerals consecutively, it can always be simplified by using a subtractive numeral in its place.
 * A special case for this simplification rule is four M's. This exceeds the 3999 limit and would be invalid unless vinculum notation
 *  or bracket notation were adopted. Using bracket notation, four M's becomes (IV).
 * 
 * Rule 6: Single use numerals:
 * **************************
 * There are individual numerals which can only appear once in any sequence.
 * All subtractive numerals can only appear once in any sequence.
 * From the set of base numerals: V,  L,  and D should only appear once.
 * The only caveat to this is when using another notation such as bracket notation.
 *  A single-use numeral can appear once within the brackets and once outside the brackets.
 *  For example, 5005 in bracket notation is (V)V.
